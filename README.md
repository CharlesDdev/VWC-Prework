# Vets Who Code Prework: Portfolio Website

Welcome to my **Vets Who Code Prework Repository**! This project is my personal portfolio website, created as part of the application and selection process for the Vets Who Code program. It showcases my skills, creativity, and passion for web development as I continue my journey toward becoming a proficient junior web/software developer.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This portfolio website serves as:

- A **showcase of my coding skills** in HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript.

Think of this portfolio as my "mixtape" – a collection of tracks (projects) that highlight my potential and hustle as an aspiring developer. Like a great hip-hop album, it’s all about making an impact and leaving a lasting impression.

## 🌟 Goals & Vision

As a hip-hop fan and gamer, I see coding as both an art form and a strategy game. My goal is to use web/software development to create meaningful digital experiences that inspire others. Joining Vets Who Code is my next step in leveling up as a developer, learning from mentors, and collaborating with fellow veterans in tech.

This portfolio is just the beginning – I’m excited to continue building projects that reflect my skills, creativity, and dedication.
